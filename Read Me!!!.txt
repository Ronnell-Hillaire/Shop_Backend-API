THis is my latest project

Run app.js
Node.js must be installed

The main purpose of this project is the learn:
					How to create a backend for eccomerce webites
					Learn noSQL databases
					How to connect to a database (MongoDB)
					Learn the basics of Dynamic web design using Document Object Model (DOM)
					Create admin Page with direct access to my database
					
This is Just the backend API

The database being used is MongoDB Atlas
			URL: https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2#/org/67338def2cbb3065a11ffbd0/projects
			Username:ronnell12321@gmail.com
			Password:Panzershrek_69

In order to access the database will need to log into my MongoDB Atlas, 

Click project0,
then go to Security on the left hand side of the page,
Click Network Access
And add your current ip address

(If this isn't done, when you run the app.js backend code it will deny access to the cluster collection/Database)

I also used postman to post/Get info to the Database for now @@
